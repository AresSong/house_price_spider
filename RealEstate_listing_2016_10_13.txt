The superior main home is a wonderful example of a tradesman being passionate about the legacy that he has created. Situated down its own sealed driveway, the home is set in a commanding position and offers the buyers an unquestionably luxurious lifestyle. Built in 2010, this 650m2 home oozes quality and spaciousness. As you enter the home through the inviting foyer you immediately get the feeling you\u2019re about to see something rather special. You would have to be impressed with the superb kitchen with its butler\u2019s pantry and all the relevant chattels. The dining room which is open plan to the kitchen plays an equally dominant role in this hub of the home. Off this area you flow into either the superior placed lounge, which in turn opens out to the sun-drenched courtyard, or the family room with its media outlets. The games room/teenage retreat also has access to the courtyard and has the advantage of a servery from the butler\u2019s pantry (ideal for the food chain for the teenagers). The home boasts 7 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, 5 toilets and 6 car garaging. The bedrooms are all generous doubles with built in organised wardrobes with 2 of them having an ensuite. The main bedroom in particular is massive with equally large ensuite and walk in wardrobe (in fact you have to see it for yourself). This bedroom even has its own sunroom which in its turn also opens out to the courtyard complete with a spa pool. The entire house has under-floor heating with some areas having radiators. A vacuum system, double glazing and large capacity water storage all play their part in the ease of living here. As if you need extra space there\u2019s the hobby room above the huge garaging. Being brick, aluminium joinery and colour steel roofing you can expect to be doing little or no maintenance. There is a lot more that could be written about this absolutely fantastic home but I must leave some room to describe the 2nd home on the property. This 4 double bedroom completely remodelled home is once again a credit to the vendors. Currently set up as an upmarket homestay, it was the original house on the property. The purchase price includes all chattels in this house. Adjacent is a large building which would easily hold 4 vehicles and attached to this is another big room which in the past has worked extremely well as a party room. Also included in the sale is a shed, henhouse and tree hut, which like the rest of the buildings, will be the envy of many a child. The overall combination of the spectacular 7 bedroom home, the delightful 4 bedroom 2nd house and the top quality land which is divided into 3 paddocks makes the opportunity to buy a lifestyle of this quality a reality. Get onto your email or phone now and make the time to see it all for yourselves. We can assure you, you won\u2019t be disappointed.
